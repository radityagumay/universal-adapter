The most boilerplate piece in developing application in Android is create a List UI Component. To implement List UI Component we have few ceremonies such as:
1. Create a List widget (in this case RecycleView)
2. Create a Adapter
3. Create a ViewHolder
4. Create a List Item widget for ViewHolder

Doing a repetitive code is not DRY at all. We wasting time to create such things. In that time, i was thinking how to reduce amount of class in doing create List UI Component.
